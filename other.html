                <h4>Patient Assistant 2017-2023</h4>

                <p>In the Netherlands one of the aims of digitalisation in healthcare is that everyone should be able to
                    view, manage and share their data online. The patient assistant services and application is a
                    project
                    with continuous updates and new features that started in 2018, this is a service for patients
                    following
                    an anticoagulation treatment in healthcare institutions from the Netherlands. This service is
                    currently
                    processing thousands of records for patients a month.</p>

                <p> As a senior developer I was in charge of leading in software design decisions and implementations in
                    communication with the team developers and the product manager. The patient assistant services were
                    divided into three micro services in charge of processing data, enriching data and serving the data
                    in a
                    rest service following the FHIR standards.</p>

                <p><b> Tech stack:</b> Linux, GIT, Bash, Scala, Scala testing libraries, Akka, Akka HTTP, Slick,
                    Postgres, Kafka,
                    Kafka Streams, Javascript, React, React testing libraries.</p>

                <h4> DVZA Services</h4>
                <small> 2019-2023</small>
                <p>The DVZA platform (data service provider in the care providers domain) is primarily used by
                    healthcare
                    institutions. The DVZA made by Portavita is currently processing millions or records of multiple
                    patients following Medmij and FHIR standards</p>

                <p>I was in charge of implementing within a team of developers multiple features requested by the
                    healthcare institutions in charge of providing to the data to be processed, the DVZA services were
                    divided in some micro services in charge of validating data, generating metrics, processing data,
                    enriching data and serving the data in multiple rest services following the FHIR standards.
                </p>

                <h4> Centro de estudios constitucionales en Bolivia </h4>
                <small> (Bachelor degree project 2013)</small>

                <p>This was one of my first projects when finishing my education at university. In collaboration with an
                    interdisciplinary group in political sciences and constitutional law at the head of the former
                    President
                    of Bolivia, Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, I got the chance to support the research and publication of
                    the
                    first free online web encyclopedia of the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of
                    Bolivia,
                    econstitucional.com</p>

                <p> The project required the implementation of a simple interface for publication of what the
                    researchers
                    were interested to be published, the whole process, organization and design of the texts were handle
                    by
                    the managers in the project, some strict guidelines were proposed in order to store the data as it
                    was
                    being publish and provide it in a web application.</p>

                <p>The Econstitucional project was a MVC application with a module for publication, a module for
                    searching
                    for specific data, a module to introduce the complete constitution by chapters and a module to
                    visualize
                    a single publication.</p>
